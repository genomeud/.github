## Scripts for Genomic data analysis from University of Udine
This series of repositories collects code used to perform genomic analysis and/or developed by the genomics group at the University of Udine (Italy). 
The repos are contributed by several people and in the framework of different projects. Detailed list of people and projects will follow!
In the meanwhile, the repos are public and usable. I hope they will be useful, and please feel free to drop a line in case you have comments or suggestions.
